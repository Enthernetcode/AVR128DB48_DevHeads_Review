## Introduction
The AVR128DB comes from the AVR DB family of microcontrollers featuring the AVR CPU, running at up to 24 MHz across the full supply voltage range of 1.8V to 5.5V. The value addition to this happens with the Analog Signal Conditioning module, Custom Configurable Logic blocks, and many more, all available in a single package. This brought us here to go hands-on and review the development kit AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano.

## Key Features
1. High-Performance AVR RISC CPU with Hardware Multiplier Running up to 24 MHz
2. 128 KB In-System self-programmable Flash Memory, 512B EEPROM, 16KB SRAM
3. Functional Safety Appliances - IEC 60730, Industrial safety – IEC 61508, Automotive safety – ISO 26262
4. Multi-Voltage I/O (MVIO)
5. Configurable Custom Logic (CCL)
6. Analog Features
   - 3 x Operational Amplifiers (OPAMPs)
   - 12-bit Differential Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
   - 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) with Output Buffer
   - 5 x USART
   - 2 x SPI, I2C Peripherals and more

## Feature Highlight
### CCL - Configurable Custom Logic
Configurable Custom Logic is an interesting feature in AVR microcontrollers that allows you to create logic circuits using a programmable look-up table. This is also known as Core Independent Peripherals (CIP) and is designed to offload simple tasks from the microcontroller’s CPU, freeing up resources for more complex tasks. There are a limited set of available digital blocks including basic gates and flip-flops that can be configured under this.

**Example**: [CCL driving an external WS2812 RGB LED strip](https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-examples/avr128da48-cnano-ws2812-mplab-mcc)

### OPAMP - Analog Signal Conditioning
The Analog Signal Conditioning peripheral features three operational amplifiers. All of these OPAMPs are implemented with a flexible connection scheme using analog multiplexers and resistor ladders, which allows a large number of analog signal conditioning configurations to be achieved.

A single OPAMP block diagram is depicted below:
<!-- Insert diagram here -->

A multiplexer at the non-inverting (+) input of each op amp allows connection to either an external pin, a wiper position from a resistor ladder, a DAC output, ground, VDD/2, or an output from another op amp. A second multiplexer at the inverting (-) input of each op amp allows connection to either an external pin, a wiper position from a resistor ladder, the output of the op amp, or DAC output. Three more multiplexers connected to each resistor ladder provide additional configuration flexibility. Two of these multiplexers select the top and bottom connections to the resistor ladder, and the third controls the wiper position.

## Advantages
1. **Versatility**: Supports a wide range of applications with its advanced peripherals and communication interfaces.
2. **Low Power**: Optimized for low power consumption, making it suitable for battery-operated devices.
3. **Development Support**: Rich ecosystem of development tools and libraries.

## Use Cases
1. **Embedded Systems**: Ideal for creating low-power embedded systems.
2. **Sensor Interfaces**: Suitable for interfacing with various sensors and actuators.
3. **Prototyping**: Great for prototyping and testing new designs quickly.
4. **IoT Devices**: Perfect for developing Internet of Things applications with low power requirements.

## Coding Practice
### Example 1: Blinking LED
```c
/* This example shows how to blink an LED connected to a GPIO pin */
void blink_led() {
    while (1) {
        gpio_set_pin_high(LED_PIN);
        delay_ms(1000);
        gpio_set_pin_low(LED_PIN);
        delay_ms(1000);
    }
}
```
### Example 2: UART Communication
```c
/* This example demonstrates basic UART communication */
void uart_communication() {
    // Initialize UART
    uart_init(UART_PORT, BAUD_RATE);
    // Send a message
    uart_send_string(UART_PORT, "Hello, AVR128DB48!");
    // Receive a message
    char received_message[100];
    uart_receive_string(UART_PORT, received_message, 100);
}
```
### Example 3: ADC Reading
```c
/* This example shows how to read a value from the ADC */
void adc_reading() {
    // Initialize ADC
    adc_init(ADC_CHANNEL);
    // Read a value from the ADC
    uint16_t adc_value = adc_read(ADC_CHANNEL);
    // Print the ADC value
    printf("ADC Value: %u\n", adc_value);
}
```
